Contributing
============

First of all, thank you to consider contributing to this open-source project!

Pull-requests are welcome!


## Contribute to statviz Go library

The statsviz API is either inexistant (when imported for its side effects) or 
very tiny (if installing the handlers yourself because you're not using 
`http.DefaultServeMux`) so it's highely unlikely that the API will change. 
That being said, there may be things to improve in the implementation, any
contribution is very welcome!


## Contribute to the user interface (html/css/javascript)

The user interface aims to be light, minimal, simple.

This program uses [vfsgen](github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen) to embed the content of 
the `/static` directory into the final binary. `vfsgen` generates the `assets`
variable in `assets_vfsdata.go`. `assets` statically implements an 
`http.FileSystem` rooted at `/static/` which contains the files statsviz serves.

While working on statsviz web interface, it's easier to directly serve the
content of the `/static` directory than regenerating the assets after each 
modification. Passing `-tags dev` to `go build` will do just that, the
directory served will be that of your filesystem.

However to commit some changes of the files in the `/static` directory, `assets`
must be regenerated (or the CI will complay anyway).
To do so just call `go generate` from the project root. With Go modules enabled,
this will download the latest version of github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen and update 
`assets_vfsdata.go` so that it reflects the new content of the `/static` 
directory. Then, commits both the changes to `/static` and those to `assets_vfsdata.go`.
