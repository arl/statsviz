Statsviz
========

Instant live visualization of your Go application runtime statistics 
(GC, MemStats, etc.).

 - Import `import _ "github.com/arl/statsviz"` (Ã  la `"net/http/pprof"`)
 - Open your browser at `http://host:port/debug/statsviz`
 - Enjoy... 


Installation
------------

```bash
go get -u github.com/arl/statsviz
```


Usage
-----

This package is typically only imported for the side effect of registering its
HTTP handler. The handled path is `/debug/statsviz/`.

If your application is not already running an HTTP server, you need to start
one. Add `"net/http"` and `"log"` to your imports and the following code to your
`main` function:

```go
go func() {
    log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
}()
```

If you are not using [http.DefaultServeMux](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http?tab=doc#ServeMux),
you will have to register the handler with the mux you are using.

Then open your browser at http://localhost:6060/debug/statsviz/
